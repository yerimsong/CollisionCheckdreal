# CollisionCheckdreal

This repository contains code for an algorithm that helps vehicles detect and avoid collision in a fast-moving environment. The algorithm is built on
the Dynamic Window Appraoch algorithm by Fox, Burgard, Thrun. The original DWA algorithm was successful in detecting stationary obstacles by 
combining translational and rotational velocities at its current state. This new algorithm upgrades this by finding admissable velocities within
a fast-moving environment.
